        <h1> Philippine International Hot air baloon festival</h1>
        <p>Ah, of course, this list wouldn't be complete without the biggest and longest-running aviation sports in the country! <br> 
            Yup, it's the Hot Air Balloon Festival of Clark, Pampanga. It is a four-day event featuring hundreds of multicolored <br> 
            and designed hot air balloons with pilots from all over the world in participation! </p>
            Did you know that the Hot Air Balloon Festival was initiated to boost the economy of Pampanga after the devastating <br> 
            eruption of Mount Pinatubo? Right. It was the idea of then Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor. Well, look at Pampanga now, <br>
            I'd say that the province was able to overcome these challenges and prospered beautifully. </p>
            The Hot Air Balloon Festival itself is aesthetically pleasing, but the festivities also feature other activities such <br> 
            as freestyle aerobatics, flag jumps, kitemaking, remote-control airplane and helicopter competition, and many <br> 
            more! Unleash the daredevil in you as you try all these breathtaking activities! </p>

        <h1>Giant Lantern Festival (ligligan parul)</h1>
        Yet another grand festivity is located at none other than the city of San Fernando! The <b>Giant Lantern Festival or Ligligan <br> 
        Parul </b>is one of the most anticipated events in Pampanga every year mainly because of its aesthetically satisfying giant parol <br> 
        lanterns! Because of this festival, the city of San Fernando was given the nickname "Christmas Capital of the Philippines". </p>
        <p>You will truly feel the Christmas spirit living within the hearts of Filipinos during the Giant Lantern Festival. <br> 
            The festivities were intended to coincide with the Simbang Gabi, as lantern competitions get bigger and brighter as <br> 
            Christmas Day comes closer and closer. The most important activity of the Ligligan Parul is the Lubenas, it is a nine <br> 
            (9)-day novena and evening procession on the eve of every Simbang Gabi. </p>
        <p>Aside from giant lantern competitions and activities, visitors also won't be disappointed with the wide variety of food <br> 
            selections available in the city! If I were you, I'd take this perfect chance to reward myself with a gastronomic feast <br> 
            of Kapampangan food!</p>
